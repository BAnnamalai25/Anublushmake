                    <p class="mid_txt5">and I would never have thought of using navy blue as eyeliner shade, but it really does work!</p>

                            <p>Have you ever wanted to really understand which makeup styles suit you, which colours light up your face and make you look radiant and healthy?</p>
                            <p>Have you ever been confused about the vast array of products available and not knowing where to begin?</p>
                            <p>Do you feel like you’re stuck in a rut with the same makeup routine for years, not knowing how to make yourself look younger, effortlessly stylish – as if you woke up looking like this?</p>
                            <p>Do you use the same makeup style for daytime and evening and don’t know how to turn your day look into a more glamorous and sophisticated evening look?</p>
                            <p class="pfive">If the answer to any or all of these is “yes,” then a makeup lesson is what you need.</p>

                            <p>The content is completely customized to suit your makeup goals and experience. When you arrive, we’ll discuss which looks you wish to learn and your biggest struggles with makeup. We also look through your existing makeup kit and brushes (please have them with you, no matter how big or small!) to assess which products are suitable and what you might need.</p>
                            <p>As part of the lessons, we work out the most flattering colour selections for you so that next time you shop for makeup, you won’t need to guess anymore and will know exactly which colours to go for.</p>
                            <p>We then go step-by-step through the all-important makeup basics, addressing facial proportions and how to maximize natural beauty. We then start creating the most flattering makeup style, demonstrating one step at a time, explaining and showing you how to do each particular step and which brushes to use, and you then repeat them guidance.</p>
                            <p class="pfive">Importantly, we’ll also show you how to correct mistakes such as wobbly eyeliner or blotchy eyeshadow blending. We’ll share many unique makeup techniques to help you create long-lasting and beauty-boosting looks.</p>
